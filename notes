CFLAGS="-Wall" #for future use after cc or gcc

cc -o compilable_filename executable_filename

you can just use make filename (without c) to compile into an exe with the right name

do use environment variables

in makefile: do not use a mix of tabs and spaces

read manual entries: puts,makefile,cc,gcc

first entry in makefile is default

learn bashscript too...

some of my man pages are missing

man 3 is the programming-oriented manual rather than man

formatted output: try it on an advanced instance when you want outputs from a sim:

int, evenly spaced ints of different lens, sci notation, etc

valgrind is amazing!

use curl and wget and github and bitbucket
